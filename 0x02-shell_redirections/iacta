ght is the birthday banquet of the seventy-year-old Mrs. Xiao, the owner of the Xiao family.

Many grandchildren, granddaughters, and grandsons-in-law gave gifts.

“Grandma, I heard that you love tea. This century-old Pu’er tea brick is worth 500,000 and is a birthday gift for you.”

“Grandma, I heard that you believe in Buddha. This jade Buddha is carved from Hetian jade and is worth 700,000.”

Old Mrs. Xiao looked at the various gifts and laughed, making the whole family happy.
At this moment, Mrs. Xiao’s eldest grandson-in-law, Marven, suddenly said: “Grandma, can you lend me a million? Aunt Lena from the orphanage has uremia and needs money for treatment.”

The entire Xiao family was shocked.

Everyone looked at Marven with incredible eyes.

This live-in son-in-law is too courageous, right? The Lady Xiao was over her birthday. Not only did he not prepare any gifts, he even dared to open his mouth and ask the Lady Xiao to borrow one million?
